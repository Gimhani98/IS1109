          My hobby is collecting stamps. It is a very interesting and useful hobby. I have a big album for my stamps. I have about 400 stamps. Some are Sri Lankan stamps and others are foreign stamps such as those from England, China, Nepal and India. I collect stamps in many ways. My uncle works in the post office. He often brings me stamps. I also exchange stamps with my friends. Iâ€™m able to learn many important facts from the stamps. I come to know about history, geography, culture and currency of a country from its stamps. So it is a useful hobby. I love this hobby very much.
